       <para>The <emphasis>ecl_keep</emphasis> attribute keeps the field in the
       generated ECL even though this field would have been hidden without this
       attribute.</para>
 
       <para>For instance, a field with <emphasis>get_data_from </emphasis>will
       be hidden, however, adding this attribute will keep this field. This is
       needed when we use <emphasis>get_data_from </emphasis>on two fields from
       each other.</para>
